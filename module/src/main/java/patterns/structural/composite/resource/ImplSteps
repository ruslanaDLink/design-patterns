--Composite Pattern Implementation Steps--

1. Create an abstract class/interface and think of it as a 'tree'.
   Its methods should be applicable for its children and composite.

2. Create a 'leaf' class with the implementation of methods of 'tree' abstraction.

3. Create a Composite with the implementation of methods 'tree' abstraction.
   It must store leaf components.
