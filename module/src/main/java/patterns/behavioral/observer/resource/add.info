Observer has a power to notify other objects when object's state is changed.
It is also called as 'pub-sub' (publisher-subscriber) pattern which uses one-to-many relationship.
To follow the instructions of Observer Pattern we need to create such components:

    - subject
    ( an interface with methods to register/unregister observer and notify others about changing its state )

    - observer
     ( an interface with the update method )

    - concrete subject
    ( class with a list of observers and implementation of subject interface)

    - concrete observer
    ( implementation of observer interface )
